                <h2>Hi, I'm Johanna</h2>
                <p>I’m a registered nurse by profession, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. When I’m not on the clock, you’ll find me diving into code as a hobbyist web developer and programmer, designing icons and typefaces, or blogging about life’s random (and occasionally dopey) moments. I’m also a full-time cat and horse enthusiast, plant parent, and someone who firmly believes that your wardrobe is way better when you’ve made it yourself. Sewing my own clothes is my little way of combining creativity with style. Life’s too short not to explore what makes you curious, so I’m always balancing my time between learning new things, creating something cool, and enjoying the simple joys like spending time with the people (and animals) I love. Stick around — it’s never boring around here.</p>
