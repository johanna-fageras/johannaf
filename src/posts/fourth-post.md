### The Importance of Hierarchy

Good typographic hierarchy is crucial for readable content. It helps users scan the page and understand the relationship between different pieces of information.

### Choosing the Right Typefaces

Selecting appropriate typefaces is one of the most important decisions in web design. The right combination of fonts can create visual interest while maintaining readability.

### Serif vs Sans-Serif

The debate between serif and sans-serif fonts continues in the digital age. While sans-serif fonts were once considered better for screens, modern high-resolution displays can render serifs beautifully.

### Font Pairing

Creating effective font pairs requires understanding contrast and harmony. Choose fonts that complement each other while maintaining distinct roles in your design.

### Technical Considerations

When implementing typography on the web, various technical aspects need consideration. From loading performance to fallback fonts, each decision impacts the user experience.
